# Keypad-Text-Identification

The primary focus of this project is to develop a computer vision program that is capable of isolating alpha numerical characters from a specified image which displays a keypad of a calculator (calculator.tif). This program will be based in Matlab and will be using operations from both Matlab and additionally the VSG toolbox. The prime objective of this program will be carried out by means of morphological reconstruction techniques, i.e. by use of operations such as ‘dilation’, ‘erosion’, ‘opening’, ‘closing’ and ‘tophat’ as well as other functions. 

The overall developed solution must hold several key attributes, one such attribute is robustness, this means the program must can process a wide range of images correctly, even if there is a variance of background noise within the image or if the image is scaled to a different proportion. The program must be fully automated, so that there is minimal to no user interaction within the program during processing.  Furthermore, all parameters within the program must be data driven, in other words values should be based off image data as opposed to being user defined. In total, the developed solution should be computationally efficient in isolating alpha numerical characters within an image.
